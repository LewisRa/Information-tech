# Introduction to Business Information Technlogy

## Business Technology Infrastucture core components
- Compute - compuatation power that needed to process tasks and handle application workload
- Network - how computing devices are interconnected with each other and talk. 
- Storage - all reliable and fault tolerant enterprise storage devices

### Compute
#### Server vs Client
- Servers has multiple powerful processors while client has a single one
- Servers have more RAM
- Faster hard drives
- Servers have more network card( laptops usually have one wired and one wireless network card)
- Servers run a server operating system while client run client operating system

**Imagine you have 100 of clients(computers)**
Option 1:  go to each client to check compliance with corporate policies (not scaleable)
Option 2: set up a server than adminster all the clients centrally from the server. Initilize corporate policies and get a status update
on their complicance all in one place. You can manage users, permissions, their accounts, passwords, ad other stuff from there, troubleshhot individual programs with clients as well. 
#### Operating Systems
**Client Operating Systems**
- Windows
- Mac OS X
- Ubuntu/Fedora

Entry level client operations system tasks
- install operating system with correct setting, device drivers, configure the printer, install software
- troubleshoot slow performance, handling , power up and down, not being able to print, not being able to connect to server
- -test if problem is with client or a server side/networking problem
- maintence - scanning for malware, monitoring performance
- deploy operating system over a network for all clients (creating a standardized custom corporate image)(desktop admin)


**Server Operating System**
- Windows Server
